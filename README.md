# 🎯 CodeAlpha - Task 2: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

This project is part of my **Data Analytics Internship at CodeAlpha**.  
For this task, I performed **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** on a dataset of the **IMDb Top 250 Movies**.  
The goal was to clean the dataset, explore its structure, identify patterns, and generate visual insights.

2. How has the **average IMDb rating** changed over the years?  
3. Is there a relationship between **movie length** and IMDb rating?  
4. Do movies with **higher vote counts** generally have higher IMDb ratings?
